There are eleven C++ programs which can be executed on Raspberry Pi 2 by first compiling using following command on terminal:
make

Then executing each program individually as:
object_files/prog_num1

object_files/prog_num2

object_files/prog_num3

object_files/prog_num4

object_files/prog_num5

object_files/prog_num6

object_files/prog_num7

object_files/prog_num8

object_files/prog_num9

object_files/prog_num10

object_files/prog_num11


To remove the executable files, please type this command and run on terminal:
make clean
